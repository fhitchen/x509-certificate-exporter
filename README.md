## üèÉ TL;DR

It only takes two commands to install x509-certificate-exporter, however you should read the instructions in the next section to
take advantage of all the features!

Add our Charts repository :

```
$ helm repo add enix https://charts.enix.io
```

Install x509-certificate-exporter for TLS Secrets monitoring with prometheus-operator support :

```
$ helm install x509-certificate-exporter enix/x509-certificate-exporter
```

To remove built-in Prometheus alerts if you'd rather craft your own :

```
$ helm upgrade x509-certificate-exporter enix/x509-certificate-exporter --reuse-values --set prometheusRules.create=false
```

If you don't use the Prometheus operator at all, and don't have the CRD, disable resource creation and perhaps add Pod
annotations for scrapping :
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
=======
```yaml
>>>>>>> 6aee8e2 (doc(x509-certificate-exporter): fix code blocks)
secretsExporter:
  podAnnotations:
    prometheus.io/port: "9793"
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
service:
  create: false
prometheusServiceMonitor:
  create: false
prometheusRules:
  create: false
```

## üìú Using the Chart

This will guide you through writing the initial set of values.

### Metrics for TLS Secrets

By default we only run a Deployment to provide metrics on TLS Secrets stored in the Kubernetes cluster. It helps
detect expiring certificates whether you manage them on your own or rely on controllers such as
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io).

> üôÇ If you're only interested in this feature, you could probably install the Chart not specifying any value.

Disable this exporter when Secrets metrics are not wanted ‚Äì if you're looking for hostPath DaemonSets only :
<<<<<<< HEAD

```
=======
```yaml
>>>>>>> 6aee8e2 (doc(x509-certificate-exporter): fix code blocks)
secretsExporter:
  enabled: false
```

### Metrics for node certificates (hostPath)

Kubernetes components use many certificates to authenticate and secure communications between each others. This PKI is
critical to the operation of a cluster and its health should be monitored carefully. Expiring Kubernetes certificates
are a common source of outages, and depending on your distribution could happen a few months after installation if left
unattended.

This Chart provides a facility to deploy `DaemonSets` so that each node of a cluster can run its own x509-certificate-exporter
and export metrics for host files :

- `etcd` server and client certificates
- Kubernetes CA
- `kube-apiserver` certificates
- `kubelet` certificates
- kubeconfig files with embedded certificates
- etc.
  Obviously it also works with any other application deployed on cluster nodes as long as it uses PEM encoded certicates
  (deployment agents, security tools, etc.).

> ‚öôÔ∏è You'll have to compile a list of files and directories of interest. There is no "one size fits all" configuration
> that we could recommend, or even a decent boilerplate. Examples below should give an idea of what to look after.

> üèôÔ∏è While having a single DaemonSet sounds like a fair option, it is not uncommon for nodes to assume different roles,
> and as a result hold different sets of certificate files requiring targeted x509-certificate-exporter configurations.
> For example, with the help of node selectors and tolerations, we can have nodes of the control plane run their own
> exporter targeting API and etcd certificates, while regular nodes would have a simpler configuration for Kubelet alone.

Deployment of hostPath exporters is controlled under the `hostPathsExporter` key of [Chart Values](#values).
All values are defaults that would apply to any number of DaemonSet you wish to run, unless overridden individually.
Then you'll need to create at least one DaemonSet in `hostPathsExporter.daemonSets`.

This is the most basic configuration. It will create one DaemonSet named `nodes` with an empty configuration. Exporters
won't export no certificate metric.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Installation
=======
This will create a DaemonSet able to monitor the same files on all nodes. It could fit a typical kubeadm cluster with no
control plane dedicated nodes :
```yaml
hostPathsExporter:
  daemonSets:
    nodes:
      watchFiles:
      - /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-ca.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/front-proxy-client.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt
      - /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
      watchKubeconfFiles:
      - /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
      - /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
      - /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
```
>>>>>>> 6aee8e2 (doc(x509-certificate-exporter): fix code blocks)

<<<<<<< HEAD
### üèÉ TL; DR
=======
Dedicated nodes will require other DaemonSets. Based on our kubeadm example, it could be extended like this :
```yaml
hostPathsExporter:
  podAnnotations:
    prometheus.io/port: "9793"
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"

The [Helm chart](https://github.com/enix/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/x509-certificate-exporter#-tldr) is the most straightforward way to get a fully-featured exporter running on your cluster.
The chart is also highly-customizable if you wish to. See the [chart documentation](https://github.com/enix/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/x509-certificate-exporter) to learn more.

The provided [Grafana Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13922) can also be used to display the exporter's metrics on your Grafana instance.

### Using Docker

A docker image is available at [enix/x509-certificate-exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/enix/x509-certificate-exporter).

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Using the pre-built binaries
=======
When it's missing and you don't have the CRD, helm will raise one of this error :
```
Error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: [unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "PrometheusRule" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1", unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"]
```
Add the following values to disable creation of `ServiceMonitors` and `PrometheusRules` :
```yaml
prometheusServiceMonitor:
  create: false
prometheusRules:
  create: false
```
Then perhaps you would need Pod annotations to work with the Kubernetes service discovery in Prometheus :
```yaml
secretsExporter:
  podAnnotations:
    prometheus.io/port: "9793"
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
```
Also in such case the headless service may not serve any purpose and can be removed :
```yaml
service:
  create: false
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Chart Values](#values) provide a few knobs to control Prometheus rules, such as numbers of days before
certificate expiration for warning and critical alerts are triggered.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Special alert `X509ExporterReadErrors` is meant to report anomalies with the exporter, such as API authorization
issues or unreadable files. If the Kubernetes API is unstable it could be disabled with
`prometheusRules.alertOnReadErrors`.\
When using hostPath exporters, and some nodes don't have all the files, it's better to add other DaemonSet profiles
to target each situation and preserve this alert. Detecting configuration regressions is especially important when
working with files that can change path over time and on cluster upgrades.

### Installing the Chart
>>>>>>> ca8ba8c (refactor(x509-exporter): set default port to 9793)

Every [release](https://github.com/enix/x509-certificate-exporter/releases) comes with pre-built binaries for many supported platforms.
Create a file named `x509-certificate-exporter.values.yaml` with your values, as discussed previously and with the help of
[Chart Values](#values).

### Using the source

The project's entry point is `./cmd/x509-certificate-exporter`.
You can run & build it as any other Go program :

```bash
go build ./cmd/x509-certificate-exporter
```

## Usage

The following metrics are available:

- `x509_cert_not_before`
- `x509_cert_not_after`
- `x509_cert_expired`
- `x509_read_errors`

### Prometheus Alerts

When installation is not performed with Helm, the following Prometheus alerting
rules may be deployed manually:

```
rules:
    - alert: X509ExporterReadErrors
        annotations:
            description: Over the last 15 minutes, this x509-certificate-exporter instance
                has experienced errors reading certificate files or querying the Kubernetes
                API. This could be caused by a misconfiguration if triggered when the exporter
                starts.
            summary: Increasing read errors for x509-certificate-exporter
        expr: delta(x509_read_errors[15m]) > 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
            severity: warning
    - alert: CertificateRenewal
        annotations:
            description: Certificate for "{{ $labels.subject_CN }}" should be renewed
                {{if $labels.secret_name }}in Kubernets secret "{{ $labels.secret_namespace
                }}/{{ $labels.secret_name }}"{{else}}at location "{{ $labels.filepath }}"{{end}}
            summary: Certificate should be renewed
        expr: ((x509_cert_not_after - time()) / 86400) < 28
        for: 15m
        labels:
            severity: warning
    - alert: CertificateExpiration
        annotations:
            description: Certificate for "{{ $labels.subject_CN }}" is about to expire
                {{if $labels.secret_name }}in Kubernets secret "{{ $labels.secret_namespace
                }}/{{ $labels.secret_name }}"{{else}}at location "{{ $labels.filepath }}"{{end}}
            summary: Certificate is about to expire
        expr: ((x509_cert_not_after - time()) / 86400) < 14
        for: 15m
        labels:
            severity: critical
```

## FAQ

### Why are you using the `not after` timestamp rather than a remaining number of seconds?

For two reasons.

First, Prometheus tends to do better storage consumption when a value stays identical over checks.

Then, it is better to compute the remaining time through a prometheus query as some latency (seconds) can exist
between this exporter check and your alert or query being run.

Here is an exemple:

```
x509_cert_not_after - time()
```

When collecting metrics from tools like Datadog that does not have timestamp functions,
the exporter can be run with the `--expose-relative-metrics` flag in order to add the following optional metrics:

- `x509_cert_valid_since_seconds`
- `x509_cert_expires_in_seconds`

### How to ensure it keeps working over time?

Changes in paths or deleted files may silently break the ability to watch critical certificates.

Because it's never convenient to alert on disapearing metrics, the exporter will publish on `x509_read_errors` how many
paths could not be read. It will also count Kubernetes API responses failures, but won't count deleted secrets.

A basic alert would be:

```
x509_read_errors > 0
```

## üìù Notes

### `watchFiles` and inode change

Because of limitations with mount binding that CRIs use to expose a single host file to a container, we cannot use
`subPath` in `volumeMounts`. This feature would in fact result in the perfect implementation where the exporter can only
access designated files. However if a certificate file is not replaced in-place and it's inode is altered, the exporter
would keep seeing the old content and can't even tell if it still exists on the host. This situation is common with
Kubernetes control-plane certificates.

Be aware that for every file path provided to `watchFiles`, the exporter container will be given read access to the
parent directory. This is how we handle the problem of changing inodes. Metrics will of course be limited to the single
targetted path, as the program is told to watch the real path from `watchFiles`.

This is to be taken into consideration if you're doing threat assessment. In such case it's recommended not to put
secret keys in the same directory as certificate files.

### Watching symbolic links

Starting with version 2.6.0, the exporter is now handling symlinks in a special way to better suit containerization and
the limited access to host filesystem.

When a symlink is added to a `watchFiles` list, we are able to resolve and read it's target as long as it's in the same
directory. This is dynamic for each metrics scrape and will track symlink changes.

A typical case of this is the Kubelet client certificate that now uses a symlink pointing to a new file each time the
certificate gets rotated.
For instance you may be using :
```yaml
watchFiles:
- /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
```
Because all client certificates reside in the `pki` directory, the exporter will be able to read
`kubelet-client-current.pem` and it's target properly. Even though the Operating System cannot resolve the link itself
in the container namespace.
